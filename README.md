# PhotoOrganizer

A Windows desktop application that automatically organizes your messy photo collections into a clean, dated folder structure by reading the EXIF metadata. Perfect for quickly sorting photos copied from your phone, camera, or SD card to your computer.

## Features

*   **Automatic Organization:** Sorts photos and videos into intuitive folders by Year, Month, and Date (e.g., `2024\08-August\2024-08-26`).
*   **EXIF-Based Sorting:** Relies on the original "date taken" metadata within each file for perfect chronological order, even after copying.
*   **Simple Interface:** An intuitive UI that anyone can use—just select your source and destination folders.
*   **Family-Friendly:** The ideal tool for parents and families to maintain a organized digital photo library.

## How It Works

1.  **Select Source:** Choose the folder where your unsorted photos are located (e.g., your phone's `DCIM` folder).
2.  **Select Destination:** Choose where you want your new organized photo library to be created.
3.  **Click Organize:** The application will read all files, extract the dates, and move them into neatly labeled folders at the destination.

### Example Folder Structure:
```
Destination Folder/
├── 2023/
│   ├── 10-October/
│   │   ├── 2023-10-25/
│   │   └── 2023-10-31/
│   └── 12-December/
│       └── 2023-12-25/
└── 2024/
    ├── 01-January/
    │   └── 2024-01-01/
    └── 08-August/
        └── 2024-08-26/
```
